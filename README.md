# Bark beetle - parametric toolpath plugin for Grasshopper

Developed by Jens Dyvik / Fellesverkstedet

Check the files in the examples folder to learn how Bark Beetle can be used for digital fabrication.

Currently the most complete set of tools are the CNC milling components. Check the CNC milling example in the Examples - Stable release folder. Make sure you specify your streaming destination as instructed in the file.

A library of easy to use components is currently being built. To install the components:

- Copy the folder "Bark beetle components" from the github repo.
- In Grasshopper go to -File, - Special folders, - User Objects Folder
- Paste the "Bark beetle components" folder into your "UserObjects" folder
- Restart Rhino and Grasshopper.
- You now have a tab in Grasshopper with Bark Beetle components
